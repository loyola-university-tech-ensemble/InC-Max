# LUTE Max Standalone for Performing Terry Riley's *In C*

This is a standalone application for performing [Terry Riley's *In C*][1], developed in [Max 7][2] by the [Loyola University Technology Ensemble][3] for laptop orchestra performance or similarly technology-augmented musical vehicle.

It comes with everything a performer will need, including a changeable ostinato pulse, MIDI output support, as well as a built-in synthesizer. All of these features can be controlled directly from a computer keyboard, but if you're feeling more intrepid use this patch as a launching point for developing new synthesizers or using other external controllers.
